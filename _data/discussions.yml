### DISCUSSION ORDERING ###
# each entry requires either a 'slug' or a 'title' field

# use the slug if you utilize the _discussions collection. this will take info
# from the front matter of the corresponding file in _discussions/
# if your filename has a leading zero, quotes are required around the slug.
# if you use the _discussions collection, the title field will be useful for
# one-off overrides like holidays or for placeholders; use the title field sparingly

# nonumber supresses the label and numbering for the discussion entry
# skip: true will omit the discussion from the schedule entirely

# link overrides the default link to the discussion page from the collection if 
# you provided a slug or provides an external link
