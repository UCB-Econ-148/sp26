Hi there! My name is Dawson. I’m a second-year master’s student in the Energy and Resources Group, where I work mostly on data science and machine learning for a sustainable future. In my free time, I also love reading, cooking, and dabbling in various outdoor activities. I’m excited to work with you all this semester!
