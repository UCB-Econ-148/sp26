Hi! I'm Zimei Xia, a 2nd-year Economics PhD student at UC Berkeley interested in public economics, IO, and trade. I previously completed a master's in Computational Social Science at UChicago and worked as a research fellow at Stanford. Excited to dig into data through an economics lens with you all :) !
