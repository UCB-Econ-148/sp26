# Resources 💻

## Textbook

We've got a [textbook](https://www.econ148.org/textbook/content/intro.html) for this course! It's written by our former GSI Rohan Jha, and is a  resource to build a solid foundation of data science for economists. We'll make sure to link relevant readings as the course progresses, but feel free to read ahead. 

## Documentation

In this course, you'll become familiar with reading lots of documentation. If you're not sure how a function works, you should type the name of the function in a cell by itself followed by `?` and run the cell (so for example, `numpy.sum?`). This will show you that function's documentation.

Official resources for you to refer to:
- [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html)

## Supplementary Readings

Each of the listed online textbooks/readings will contain some material that is not in scope for our class. They all cover the fundamentals of Python, but in slightly different ways. As a reminder, you're not required to look at any of these; only look if you think they'll help you.

- [Learning Data Science](https://learningds.org/intro.html), the textbook for Data 100 at UC Berkeley. It is an introductory textbook for data science that will be published with O’Reilly Media in 2023. It covers foundational skills in programming and statistics that encompass the data science lifecycle.
 - [Data 100 Course Notes](https://ds100.org/course-notes/), the course notes for Data 100, a huge resource for most things that we will cover in this class.
- [Computational and Inferential Thinking](http://inferentialthinking.com), the textbook for Data 8 at UC Berkeley.
- [Stanford's Python Reference](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/py), a Python guide written for Stanford's intro CS class, is a great reference if you need a refresher on how something works.
- [Python Programming for Data Science](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/chapters/chapter1-basics.html) and [Dive Into Data Science](https://eldridgejm.github.io/dive_into_data_science/front.html) are also good references that are written for different classes (at UBC and UCSD, respectively) that cover the material relevant in our class and more.
- [Composing Programs](http://composingprograms.com), the textbook for CS 61A and CS 88 at UC Berkeley, covers Python from a more traditional computer science perspective rather than the data science perspective we will take; as such, only a few sub-chapters are relevant to us but you may find it useful nonetheless. 
- [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) is also a great reference.
